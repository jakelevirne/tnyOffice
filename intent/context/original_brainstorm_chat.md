#### Gdocs for Markdown idea (July 19, 2025, 6:00:01 PM EDT Eastern Daylight Time)

**user**

i have an intuition that there needs to be something like gdocs for markdown. like you need both collab and publishing and a format that's universal. help me think through why or why not for this intuition.

**ChatGPT**

love this hunch. “gdocs for markdown” = real‑time collab + easy publishing + a durable, portable source format. here’s a quick decision lens.

# Why this *could* be right
- **Universal-ish source of truth.** Markdown is the lingua franca for specs, docs, READMEs, and dev writing. Storing truth as `.md` keeps you future‑proof and repo‑friendly.
- **Collab is the missing piece.** Most markdown tools nail authoring or publishing, not Google‑grade multiplayer (live cursors, comments, suggestions, roles).
- **One-click publish closes the loop.** Draft → review → ship to a beautiful site without exporting or switching tools = fewer seams, fewer stale copies.
- **Doc‑as‑code + AI era.** Teams want docs that live next to code, but they still want non‑technical contributors in the same space. Markdown bridges both. AI also spits out Markdown constantly.

# Why it’s tricky / maybe wrong
- **“Universal” isn’t universal.** CommonMark vs GFM vs MDX vs RMarkdown vs callouts/mermaid/admonitions → dialect creep. Your product must choose a base and be stubborn about extensions.
- **Track changes on plain text is hard.** Suggestions, anchored comments, and permissions on *ranges* need CRDT/OT + stable anchors. If you serialize wrong, comments drift or vanish.
- **Rich features fight Markdown’s simplicity.** Tables, footnotes, citations, embeds, references, equations, RTL/i18n, accessibility—all get awkward in raw MD. You’ll need a rich layer that still round‑trips cleanly.
- **Competition is “good enough.”** Many tools do parts of this (great editor, great publish, or great git). To win, your *combo* must be meaningfully better, not just tidier.

# What you’d have to absolutely nail
- **Collab model.** Real‑time CRDT (e.g., Yjs/Automerge), presence, per‑block comments, suggestions/accept, and share links with granular perms. Comments must survive refactors (anchor to AST nodes, not just character offsets).
- **Dialect policy.** Pick: CommonMark + GFM (tables/task lists/strikethrough/footnotes) + a *short* allowlist (frontmatter, mermaid, callouts). Make everything else a plugin behind a feature flag.
- **Dual editing modes.** “Rich” WYSIWYM block editor for humans + “Source” CodeMirror for purists. Perfect round‑trip; no invisible trash in the file.
- **Publishing.** Themeable static output (SEO, ToC, search, canonical URLs), preview links, drafts, and instant rollback. Offer MDX‑style islands *carefully* so you don’t break portability.
- **Git bridge (optional but killer).** Two‑way sync to a repo, PR previews, branch‑scoped review. Keep comments/suggestions in sidecar metadata so the `.md` stays clean.
- **Link integrity + graph.** Backlinks, unresolved link warnings, orphan detection, and “rename with redirect” so your site never 404s after refactors.

# Opinionated product thesis
> A multiplayer Markdown workspace that feels like Google Docs, round‑trips like Git, and publishes like a static site generator—without leaving the editor.

# MVP slice (6–8 weeks, focused)
1) **Editor core:** CodeMirror 6 + Yjs, live cursors, comments on selections, basic suggestions (insert/replace/delete), CommonMark+GFM parser (mdast).  
2) **Clean publish:** Remark/Rehype → static HTML, one elegant default theme, site‑wide search, draft links.  
3) **Import/export:** Perfect `.md` import/export, frontmatter preserved.  
4) **Guardrails:** Dialect linter and “portable mode” badge when a doc stays within your baseline.

# Traps to avoid
- **MDX everywhere.** It’s powerful but kills portability. Keep it sandboxed to “interactive blocks” with clear fences.
- **Comment drift.** If comments are anchored by raw indices, they’ll break on edits. Map them to AST nodes with stable IDs.
- **Hidden proprietary glue.** If publishing or collaboration depends on opaque markers in the file, you’ve recreated a lock‑in format in disguise.

# Where the wedge could be (your context)
- **Specs & product docs** (your sweet spot): PR‑style review, per‑section approvals, link to AI chat history as provenance, and “publish to stakeholder site” in one click.  
- **Docs teams & OSS:** Free for public repos, paid for private + advanced collab.  
- **Differentiator:** rock‑solid round‑trip + Git bridge + beautiful publish by default. Most rivals compromise on at least one.

# Quick next steps to de‑risk
- Build a tiny collab demo: paragraph blocks, comments, suggestions, and a publish button.  
- Test with 3 real specs from your team: import → edit together → publish → iterate.  
- Measure: time to first published doc, % of comments that stay anchored after heavy edits, and how often authors drop to “source mode.”

If you want, I can sketch a concrete architecture for anchors/suggestions (AST + CRDT), the exact CommonMark+GFM extension list, and a minimal publish pipeline that won’t paint you into a corner.
