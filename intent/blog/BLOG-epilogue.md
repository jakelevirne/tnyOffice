# Building TnyOffice: The Delete Feature

## The Architecture That Emerged

After 28 hours of building, TnyOffice had transformed from vision to working system:

**The Technical Stack:**
- Monorepo with Next.js apps and shared packages
- Express API with SQLite persistence
- Automerge CRDTs for conflict-free collaboration
- CodeMirror 6 for rich editing
- WebSockets for real-time sync
- Git integration for version control
- Deployed on Fly.io and Vercel

**The Features:**
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Comments with automatic position tracking
- Git sync with diff-based merging
- Undo/redo with user-specific history
- API authentication
- Interactive documentation

**The Philosophy:**
- Start simple, build incrementally
- Choose the right primitives (CRDTs for collaboration)
- Let technology shape architecture
- External changes should feel like collaboration
- Every decision considers production

## The Patterns and Lessons

### Development Rhythm
- **Friday evening**: Dream and plan
- **Friday night**: Build and hit walls
- **Saturday morning**: Research and understand
- **Saturday afternoon**: Extend and integrate
- **Saturday evening**: Secure and polish

### Key Insights
1. **Build it twice to build it right** - First API taught domain model, second taught persistence
2. **Small decisions compound** - Logger becomes observability, linting becomes safety net
3. **Technology choice determines architecture** - CRDTs eliminated entire categories of problems
4. **Local-first with eventual consistency** - Each user edits their copy, all converge to same state
5. **Simple interfaces hiding sophisticated implementation** - Delete isn't just removing a row

### The Meta-Level
This wasn't just about building an editor. It was about:
- Understanding the problem space deeply
- Choosing foundations that make hard things possible
- Building incrementally with clear boundaries
- Thinking production from day one
- Learning from each failure and pivot

## The Result

In one weekend, TnyOffice evolved from "GDocs for markdown" intuition to a working system with:
- True real-time collaboration without conflicts
- Clean markdown that round-trips perfectly
- Git integration for version control
- Comments that survive document changes
- Production-ready security
- Deployment infrastructure

The dream from Friday evening was now a URL anyone could visit. Not through grand features, but through careful additions that each made the whole more complete.

The prototype had become something more—a demonstration that with the right foundations, modern tools, and focused execution, complex collaborative systems can emerge from simple beginnings.

## Epilogue: The Continuing Story

This weekend sprint wasn't the end—it was the beginning. Each feature revealed new possibilities, each implementation taught new lessons. The gap between single-player markdown and collaborative documentation had been bridged.

TnyOffice proved that the intuition was right: There did need to be something like Google Docs for markdown. And now, there was.
